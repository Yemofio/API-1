# API-1
# Node.js Express API for Advanced Search Functionality

This is a Node.js API that connects a website to a remote database server and allows for advanced search functionalities in JSON format. The API uses Express.js for routing and JSON schema for request and response validation. API keys are used for authentication and authorization mechanisms.

## Setup

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies by running `npm install`.
3. Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your desired API key using the following format: `API_KEY=your-api-key`.
4. Create a `config.js` file in the root directory and add your database configuration information.
5. Start the server by running `npm start`.

## Endpoints

The API includes the following endpoints:

### POST /api/search

This endpoint performs an advanced search based on the provided query and filters. The request payload should be in the following format:

```json
{
  "query": "your search query",
  "filters": {
    "filter1": "value1",
    "filter2": "value2",
    "filter3": "value3"
  }
}
```

The response payload will be in the following format:

```json
{
  "results": [
    {
      "id": "1",
      "name": "Product A",
      "description": "Description of Product A"
    },
    {
      "id": "2",
      "name": "Product B",
      "description": "Description of Product B"
    },
    {
      "id": "3",
      "name": "Product C",
      "description": "Description of Product C"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Customization

To customize this API for your own project, follow these steps:

1. Modify the `config.js` file to match your database configuration information.
2. Implement your own search functionality in the `/api/search` endpoint handler.
3. Modify the JSON schema files in the `schemas` directory to match your request and response formats.
